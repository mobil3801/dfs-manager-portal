🎯 **Important Requirement Update**

@mobil3801 has specified that **everything in this project should be connected by Supabase database & storage**. This means:

## Complete Supabase Integration Required:

### 🗄️ Database
- All data operations must use Supabase Database
- No remnants of EZSite APIs should remain
- All tables must be properly migrated to Supabase

### 📁 Storage  
- All file uploads, images, and documents must use **Supabase Storage**
- Replace any existing file handling with Supabase Storage buckets
- Update the `imageErrorService.ts` to use Supabase Storage URLs
- Logo images, product images, license documents - everything goes through Supabase Storage

### 🔐 Authentication
- Complete migration to Supabase Auth
- No EZSite authentication remnants

### 🔗 API Integration
- All external API calls should go through Supabase (Edge Functions if needed)
- SMS services, external integrations - configure through Supabase

Please ensure this is a **complete migration** where Supabase becomes the single source of truth for all data persistence and file storage needs.
